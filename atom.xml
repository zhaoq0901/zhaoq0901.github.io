<h1 id="what-is-engels-law">What is Engel's Law?</h1>
<p><strong><code>Engel's Law</code>: As household's income , the % of income spent on food will decrease, although the amount of food expenditure may increase.</strong></p>
<p>This means when people solve their basic living cost, they will have more spending on other goods and services, such as education and recreation.</p>
<p><code>Engel's Coefficient</code> = Food Expenditure / Household Income</p>
<ul>
<li>Close to 1:
<ul>
<li>The family spent <strong>most</strong> of their income on food</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Close to 0:
<ul>
<li>The family spent <strong>less</strong> of their income on food</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-should-we-care">Why should we care?</h2>
<p>By calculating the Engel's coefficient, we can know the familiy's living standard. If their coefficient is high, that means they are struggling with food accessibility. Therefore, they lack money for other services, such as education and healthcare.</p>
<h1 id="research-question">Research Question</h1>
<p><strong>What is the relationship between <code>Household Income</code> and <code>Food Expenditure</code> in the U.S. from 2015 to 2019?</strong></p>
<p>Why <code>Household Income</code>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Since indiviude may have different eating habits, such as vegetarian or anorexia, those will the factor to affect the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is <code>Food Expenditure</code>?</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of money spent on food (Food-at-home &amp; Food-away-from-home)
<ul>
<li>Food-at-home (FAH):
<ul>
<li>The food and beverages purchased from grocery stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, and other retail outlets for consumption at home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Food-away-from-home (FAFH):
<ul>
<li>All meals and snacks purchased from restaurants, cafes, fast-food outlets, and other establishments where food is prepared and consumed outside the home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why <code>2015 to 2019</code>?</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to do the researching in 5 years period. However, due to the pendamic happend, the 2020 data of household income is missing, and the food expenditure data weren't update after 2023.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>
<ul>
<li>Dataset:
<ul>
<li><code>US Census</code>: Household Income American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimate</li>
<li><code>USDA</code>: Food Expenditure Series</li>
<li><code>USDA</code>: Current Population Survey (CPS) Food Security Supplement</li>
</ul>

<p>This geographic heatmap indicates families' Engel coefficients by states. <strong>The color gets darker when families from that state have an Engel coefficient close to 1</strong>, which means they are struggling with basic food needs.</p>

<p><code>Expectation</code>: Engel Coefficient (%) is high because the family has less household income</p>
<p>Low income family needs to put more money on food.</p>
<p><strong>However, there is an outlier: California.</strong></p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="4"><img src="https://zhaoq0901.github.io/post-images/1753586129185.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Consistently from 2015 to 2019: <em>although people from California can make a good amount of money, there are still a lot of families that are struggling with food security.</em></p>

<figure data-type="image" tabindex="6"><img src="https://zhaoq0901.github.io/post-images/1753586299263.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p><u>The documentation of the Current Population Survey (CPS) states that the data represents 20% of the California population. </U></p>
<p>Therefore, 20% of California's population experiences food insecurity.</p>
<p>Among these families, 90% of them are receiving food from the food distribution program or are on the <em>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</em></p>
<p>The rest 10% are hard to access nutritious food, and even skip meals every day.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The data analysis mostly supports Engel's Law.</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher household income → lower % of income spent on food</li>
<li>Familes with higher household income can inveset their money on other supplement goods or services beyong the basic needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, under certain circumstances (such as CA), Engel's Law may not hold true. The potential reason behind this could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food prices</li>
<li>Population density</li>
<li>Distance from grocery stores</li>
</ul>

<p>The R value close to 0 indicates the inverse relationship between MHI and FIR is weak. In addition, the R^2 values are also close to 0, suggesting that the linear regression lines lack reliability in explaining the data. <strong>This is likely due to the drought that happens between 2014 to 2017.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Impacted agricultural production</li>
<li>Food is unaffordable for both high-MHI and low-MHI families.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As shown in the graph, the California Drought Maps from the U.S. Drought Monitor, the intensity of drought has four levels. We can see through the x-value that the exceptional drought with other level drought took place during 2014 to 2017 affecte average 50% California land area.</p>
<p><strong>The drought directly impacted food production rates, making food unaffordable for both high MHI and low MHI families. This explains why the data from 2014 to 2017 deviate from our hypothesis.</strong></p>
<h1 id="measuring-the-correlation-between-mhi-fir-by-districts">Measuring the Correlation Between MHI &amp; FIR by districts.</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Red districts</strong> show a strong negative correlation (R close to -1).</li>
<li><strong>Lighter red and White districts</strong> indicate weaker or no correlation between MHI and FIR.</li>
<li><strong>Blue districts</strong> show a positive correlation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last part of our finding, we wanted to examine how strong the relationship was in each district, so we looked at ten years of data for each district and calculated the R-value. <strong>The closer the R-value is to -1, the stronger the negative relationship is.</strong></p>
<p>As you can see on the heatmap, many districts such as the <code>North Coast</code> and <code>Bay Area</code> are shaded red, meaning they have a strong negative correlation. The white districts, such as those <code>near the eastern state border</code>, show a weaker or no clear relationship. To our surprise, the blue districts such as parts of the <code>San Joaquin Valley</code> show a positive correlation, which is the opposite of what we expected. In these areas, income and food insecurity both go up together.</p>
<p>For the outliers, we suspect that in blue areas, higher living costs relative to wages and the presence of seasonal and agricultural workers contribute to unexpected positive correlations. In white areas, small populations and economies heavily reliant on tourism make it difficult to find a clear pattern between income and food insecurity.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We found that <strong>there is a inverse relationship between food insecurity rates and income.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As income increases, food insecurity rates tend to decrease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower income households are more likely to experience food insecurity.</p>

<h1 id="tree">Tree</h1>
<p>Tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in the form of parent child relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Terminologies In Tree Data Structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parent Node<br>
Child Node<br>
Root Node<br>
Leaf Node or External Node<br>
Ancestor of a Node<br>
Descendant<br>
Sibling<br>
Level of a node<br>
Internal node<br>
Neighbour of a Node<br>
Subtree</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tree Traversal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm
<ul>
<li><code>Inorder traversal</code>: Visits all nodes inside the left subtree, then visits the current node before visiting any node within the right subtree.</li>
<li><code>Preorder traversal</code>: Visits the current node before visiting any nodes inside left or right subtrees.</li>
<li><code>Postorder traversal</code>: Visits the current node after visiting all the nodes of left and right subtrees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm
<ul>
<li>Starts from the root node and visits all nodes of current depth before moving to the next depth in the tree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Binary tree</strong></p>
<p>A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.</p>

<p><strong>One sentence of Java abstract data type (ADT): a type of data type whose behaviour is defined by a set of operations and values.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ADT defines the logical form of the data type v.s. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.</li>

<h1 id="arraylist">ArrayList</h1>
<p><strong>An ArrayList is like a resizable array.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one). While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want.</p>

<h1 id="linkedlist">LinkedList</h1>
<p>The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type. <em>It works the same as ArrayList. However, they built very differently.</em></p>
<p>The <code>ArrayList</code> class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.</p>
<p>The <code>LinkedList</code> stores its elements in &quot;containers.&quot; The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.</p>
